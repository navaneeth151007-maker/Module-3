# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```c
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
element = 30
if element in my_tuple:
    print(element, "exists in the tuple.")
else:
    print(element, "does NOT exist in the tuple.")

```
## Output

## Result
Thus, the program has been executed successfully.
